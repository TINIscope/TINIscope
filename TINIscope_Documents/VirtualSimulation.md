# Computater simulation for TINIscope implantation

When implanting multiple TINIscopes, it is essential to design proper equipment arrangements to avoid spatial conflicts and balance weight. To achieve this, Solidworks was utilized for simulating the implantation and determining optimal solutions through three steps. 
* **Firstly**, a standard 3D model of the whole mouse brain and targeted brain regions was downloaded from the [Allen Brain Atlas](https://download.alleninstitute.org/informatics-archive/current-release/mouse_ccf/annotation). 
  
* **Secondly**, the downloaded models and 3D model of TINIscopes were imported into Solidworks. 
  
* **Lastly**, the GRIN lens of each TINIscope was fixed to the target area, and the orientation of each TINIscope was adjusted to achieve the best arrangement. The final orientation of each TINIscope was then exported to guide surgical implantation.
