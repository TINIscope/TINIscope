## Machined or Printer Parts 
The design files for the TINIscope housing and base plate can be found in the "TINIscope-Housing" folder of this repository. 

There are 3 parts 3D printed by the printer Form 2 from formlabs. The material is their normal blackresin. Form3 has also been tested to achieve better printing resolution with same material. The optional materials could be PU Rigid 1000/650 Resin, which are more durable from their description. However, these materials were unable to be purchased from our areas and therefore we did not test them.

### Housing

The main housing of TINIscope fits all the optical parts. A intruction will help to illustrate how to assemble it with these optical parts, pleaase refer to the [Step-by-step assembly](./TINIscope_Documents/Assembly.md).

### Slider

The slider is used to fit the CMOS image sensor and mate with the housing to adjust the focal plane of TINIscope. A longer slider range could achieve wider adjustment range of focal palne. The slider has a hole to fit with with a M1 self-tapping screw, after the adjustment of focal plane is finished, the screw help to secure it with the housing.
