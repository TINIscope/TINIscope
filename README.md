In this project repository, we introduce TINIscope, a **Tightly Integrated Neuronal Imaging microscope** optimized for electronic and opto-mechanical design. With its compact and lightweight design of 0.43 g, TINIscope enables unprecedented simultaneous imaging of behavior-relevant activity in up to four brain regions in mice. Moreover, TINIscope can be combined with additional modules to facilitate optogenetics, electrical stimulation, or local field potential recordings, allowing for multi-modal experimental design. Overall, TINIscope represents a timely and indispensable tool for studying the brain-wide interregional coordination that underlies unrestrained behaviors.



## Features

TINIscope features an ultra-compact size and an incredibly light weight, enabling the option to wear four of them on a single mouse. The key specifications are outlined below:

| Field of view(FOV)          | 450 × 450  μm    |
| Weight of single unit       | 0.43g            |
| Dimensions                  | 4.6×13.8×8.24 mm |
| Typical oprating frame rate | 40 Hz            |
| Optical resolution          | 2.2 μm           |
| Adjustment of focal range   | ~0-200 μm        |
| Cable length                | 50/70 cm         |

## Overview 
As standalone equipment, TINIscope reaches a new level of miniaturization in head-mounted microscopes, reducing the burden added to smaller or developing animals like juvenile songbirds. Based on the TINIscope design, we further systematically developed an experimental paradigm, including multi-site implantations and a commutator for untangling, for multi-region calcium imaging in freely behaving mice. 

In this repository, our goal is to present our work in the development of optics, electronics, and mechanics pertaining to various aspects of TINIscope. We cover topics such as the lightpath, housing, baseplate, commutator system, and provide useful guidelines for conducting experiments.

# Overview and system components
Our system is comprised of head mounted microscope, DAQ borad, GUI for data aquisition and a commutator system. The related files are put into separate folders. The ompmization of its electronic, mechanical and optical parts of headed mounted microscope makes it flexible to implant mutliple units in a freely moving mice cortically and subcortically. Since deciphering complex behavior has an urgent demand for tools to perform concurrent cellular-resolution calcium imaging in brain-wide regions of freely behaving animals, TINIscope has an advantage, among others, to deal with these tough scienctific questions.  
The master partlist of TINIscope is attached [here](https://github.com/TINIscope/TINIscopeMasterPartList/blob/main/TINIscope%20Master%20Parts%20List.xlsx). To set up our system, one can purchase the necessary parts depending on the lish and follow the instruciton below to know how to assemble the system.
