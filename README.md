Welcome to the introduction of TINIscope. TINIscope is a timely tool for studying the mechanisms underlying complex behaviors or cognitive tasks, which inevitably require interactions among multiple cortical and sub-cortical areas. With its significant reduction of weight (0.43g) and size, TINIscope is able to image to up to 4 brain regions subcortically. Here we provide a brief introduction to illustrate how to use the files in repository to set up TINIscope system.

## Features

TINIscope features an ultra-compact size and an incredibly light weight, enabling the option to wear four of them on a single mouse. The key specifications are outlined below:

| Specications                | Value            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Field of view(FOV)          | 450 × 450  μm    |
| Weight of single unit       | 0.43g            |
| Dimensions                  | 4.6×13.8×8.24 mm |
| Typical oprating frame rate | 40 Hz            |
| Optical resolution          | 2.2 μm           |
| Adjustment of focal range   | ~0-200 μm        |
| Cable length                | 50/70 cm         |

# Overview and system components
Our system is comprised of head mounted microscope, DAQ borad, GUI for data aquisition and a commutator system. The related files are put into separate folders. The ompmization of its electronic, mechanical and optical parts of headed mounted microscope makes it flexible to implant mutliple units in a freely moving mice cortically and subcortically. Since deciphering complex behavior has an urgent demand for tools to perform concurrent cellular-resolution calcium imaging in brain-wide regions of freely behaving animals, TINIscope has an advantage, among others, to deal with these tough scienctific questions.  
The master partlist of TINIscope is attached [here](https://github.com/TINIscope/TINIscopeMasterPartList/blob/main/TINIscope%20Master%20Parts%20List.xlsx). To set up our system, one can purchase the necessary parts depending on the lish and follow the instruciton below to know how to assemble the system.
